# Dependencies from your original list that were less constrained:
# You'll need to find their appropriate Py3.6 versions or let pip-tools figure it out.
# For now, let's assume they are also pinned or compatible:
pybtex>=0.24.0          # Example pin, check latest compatible with Py3.6
feedparser>=6.0.11      # Example pin, seems compatible
python-markdown-math>=0.8 # Example pin, seems compatible

# Other common transitive dependencies (often good to pin for Py3.6):
six>=1.16.0             # Or 1.17.0 - very common, usually stable
# dataclasses==0.8      # If not already pulled in by others for Py3.6
# typing_extensions~=3.7.4 # Older versions are safer for Py3.6 if issues with 4.x
