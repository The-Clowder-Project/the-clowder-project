\section{Introduction}\label{section-introduction}
\subsection{Content and Scope}\label{subsection-scope}
In this section, we outline what content is expected to be covered in the Clowder Project.
\subsubsection{Elementary Category Theory}\label{subsubsection-elementary-category-theory}
First and foremost, the Clowder Project aims to cover the foundations of category theory. This comprises all the usual topics treated in basic textbooks in category theory, such as \cite{categories-for-the-working-mathematician} or \cite{category-theory-in-context}, like adjunctions, co/limits, Kan extensions, co/ends, monoidal categories, etc.
\subsection{Goals}\label{subsection-goals}
\subsubsection{Filling Gaps in the Literature}\label{subsubsection-filling-gaps-in-the-literature}
There are a number of very significant gaps in the category theory literature, some of which the Clowder Project hopes to fill. Here we list them.%
%--- Begin Footnote ---%
\footnote{%
    See also \cite{MO494959}.
}%
%---  End Footnote  ---%
\begin{gap}{The Tensor Product of Presentable Categories}{subsection-gap-the-tensor-product-of-presentable-categories}%
    Even though its analogue for $\infty$-categories has for years been a widely used tool%
    %--- Begin Footnote ---%
    \footnote{%
        See \cite{MO490557}.
        \par\vspace*{\TCBBoxCorrection}
    }, %
    %---  End Footnote  ---%
    a comprehensive treatment of the tensor product of presentable categories seems to be currently missing.
\end{gap}
\begin{gap}{Explicit Descriptions of Co/Limits of Categories}{subsection-gap-explicit-descriptions-of-co-limits-of-categories}%
    An exhaustive concrete description of the various limits and colimits of categories, including 2-dimensional ones such as coequifiers, isoinserters, etc.
\end{gap}
\begin{gap}{Dinatural Transformation Co/Classifiers}{subsection-gap-dinatural-transformation-co-classifiers}%
    Dinatural transformation co/classifiers, characterised by isomorphisms of the form $\Nat(F,G)\cong\DiNat(\Gamma(F),G)$.%
    %--- Begin Footnote ---%
    \footnote{%
        Although these appear already in Dubuc--Street's paper introducing dinatural transformations, \cite{dubuc-street-dinatural-transformations}, it seems that all foundational treatments that followed after ended up not covering this concept.
    }%
    %---  End Footnote  ---%
\end{gap}
\begin{gap}{The Tensor Product of Symmetric Monoidal Categories}{subsection-gap-the-tensor-product-of-symmetric-monoidal-categories}%
    A treatment of the tensor product of symmetric monoidal categories, replicating \cite{the-symmetric-monoidal-2-category-of-permutative-categories} for the non-strict case.
\end{gap}
\begin{gap}{A Comprehensive Treatment of the Theory of Promonoidal Categories}{subsubsection-gap-a-comprehensive-treatment-of-the-theory-of-promonoidal-categories}%
    A comprehensive and exhaustive treatment of the theory of promonoidal categories, including notions such as dualisability internal

    and how these may be viewed as categorifications of \say{hypermonoids}.
