\subsection{Content and Scope}\label{subsection-scope}
In this section, we outline what content is expected to be covered in the Clowder Project.
\subsubsection{Elementary Category Theory}\label{subsubsection-elementary-category-theory}
First and foremost, the Clowder Project aims to cover the foundations of category theory. This comprises all the usual topics treated in basic textbooks in category theory, such as \cite{categories-for-the-working-mathematician} or \cite{category-theory-in-context}, like adjunctions, co/limits, Kan extensions, co/ends, monoidal categories, etc.

\subsection{Community Engagement and Collaboration}\label{subsection-community-engagement-and-collaboration}
\section{Goals}\label{section-goals}
\subsection{Filling Gaps in the Literature}\label{subsection-filling-gaps-in-the-literature}
The Clowder Project aims to address several significant gaps in the existing literature on category theory, as detailed below.

\begin{gap}{The Tensor Product of Presentable Categories}{gap-the-tensor-product-of-presentable-categories}%

    %---  End Footnote  ---%
    a comprehensive treatment of the tensor product of presentable categories seems to be currently missing.
\end{gap}
\begin{gap}{Explicit Descriptions of Co/Limits of Categories}{gap-explicit-descriptions-of-co-limits-of-categories}%
    An exhaustive concrete description of the various limits and colimits of categories, including 2-dimensional ones, is missing.
\end{gap}
\begin{gap}{Dinatural Transformation Co/Classifiers}{gap-dinatural-transformation-co-classifiers}%
    There seems to be no unified presentation of dinatural transformation co/classifiers in the literature. These are characterised by isomorphisms of the form
    \[
        \Nat(F,G)%
        \cong%
        \DiNat(\Gamma(F),G),%
    \]%
    and were originally studied in Dubuc--Street's paper introducing dinatural transformations, \cite{dubuc-street-dinatural-transformations}.

    \indent Even though these arguably form a fundamental piece of the framework of co/end calculus, it seems that all foundational treatments that followed after ended up not covering this concept.
\end{gap}
\begin{gap}{The Tensor Product of Symmetric Monoidal Categories}{gap-the-tensor-product-of-symmetric-monoidal-categories}%
    The tensor product of symmetric monoidal categories had been a missing concept from the literature for years. Recently, \cite{the-symmetric-monoidal-2-category-of-permutative-categories} covered the case of permutative categories. It would be nice, however, to also have a treatment of the non-strict case available.
\end{gap}
\begin{gap}{A Comprehensive Treatment of the Theory of Promonoidal Categories}{gap-a-comprehensive-treatment-of-the-theory-of-promonoidal-categories}%
    A comprehensive and exhaustive treatment of the theory of promonoidal categories is currently missing. There are several important notions undefined, like:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Promonoidal profunctors.
        \item Dualisability internal to a promonoidal category.
        \item Invertibility internal to a promonoidal category.
    \end{itemize}
    Moreover, it would be nice to record how promonoidal categories may be viewed as categorifications of \say{hypermonoids} (i.e.\ monoids in $\Rel$).
\end{gap}
\begin{gap}{A Comprehensive Treatment of the Theory of Multicategories}{gap-a-comprehensive-treatment-of-the-theory-of-multicategories}%
    A comprehensive and exhaustive treatment of the theory of multicategories is currently missing. There are several important notions undefined, like:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Co/limits internal to multicategories.
    \end{itemize}
    See \cite{MO484647}.
